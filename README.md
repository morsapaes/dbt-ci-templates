[Materialize](https://materialize.com/) is a streaming database purpose-built for fast-changing data. If you've ever wished you could run your dbt models, sit back and have the database keep things up-to-date for you...this is it. :lotus_position:

As we continue exploring the possibilites of using dbt and Materialize together, we started working on some templates that you can use and adapt to your own [`dbt-materialize`](https://materialize.com/docs/integrations/dbt/) deployments. We'll continue expanding this repository with more workflows, also using other CI/CD platforms. To give these examples a go, [sign up for a Materialize account](https://materialize.com/register/)!
